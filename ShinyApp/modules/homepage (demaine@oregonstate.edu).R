             <h1>Welcome to the MIR Soil Property Platform</h1>
             
             <p>The MIR Soil Property Platform is a user-friendly, fast, web-based platform for soil property estimation from MIR spectra.  After uploading MIR spectra, some preprocessing, and choosing and executing a prediction model, this platform will provide soil property estimates with a prediction accuracy. 
             <br>
             <p>This web tool has four components :

                              Our static models were developed using the NRCS-KSSL spectral dataset, a legacy database containing over 80,000 soil samples and their corresponding spectra. These models allow you to predict 19 soil properties that include physical, chemical, and biological properties.

                            <p>
                              The static models were developed using five advanced machine-learning techniques:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li><strong>Partial Least Squares (PLS)</strong> – A robust regression method commonly used for spectral data analysis.</li>
                              <li><strong>Random Forest (RF)</strong> – A tree-based ensemble model that improves accuracy by averaging multiple decision trees.</li>
                              <li><strong>Cubist</strong> – A rule-based predictive modeling approach that enhances decision tree methods.</li>
                              <li><strong>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</strong> – A powerful algorithm for classification and regression tasks.</li>
                              <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</strong> – A deep learning model designed for complex pattern recognition in spectral data.</li>

                            <p>
                              Our models are tailored to various soil and environmental conditions, ensuring adaptability across different landscapes. You can select models based on: <strong>Soil Order, Texture Classes, MLRA (Major Land Resource Area), Land Use &amp; Land Cover (LULC), Sample Depths</strong>.<br>
                              In addition to condition-specific models, we also provide <strong>Global Models</strong>—trained using the entire NRCS-KSSL dataset—to offer generalized predictions.

(The static models were trained using 70% of the data and tested on the remaining 30%. The accuracy matrix reflects the model's performance on the validation set.)

                                <em>Spectral Plots</em>: These plots overlay your spectral data with the spectral data from the selected model, allowing you to visually assess compatibility.<br>
                                <em>PCA Plots</em>: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots compare your data with the dataset used to train the model. If your data points are far from the KSSL data in the PCA plot, consider selecting a different model for better predictions.

                            <h3>Customized Models Overview</h3>
                            <p>
                              If you have spectral data and want to develop machine learning models using legacy data with spectra similar to your local data, the Customized Model tab is the ideal option for you. This feature allows you to refine and personalize the built-in models by leveraging the similarity of your spectral data to legacy data.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <h4>How It Works</h4>
                            <p>
                              The Customized Model tab uses the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm in the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) space. This method identifies spectra from the legacy dataset that are similar to your local spectral data. These “neighboring” spectra are then used to adjust and customize the machine learning models, improving the predictions for your specific dataset.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <h4>Available Machine Learning Models for Customization</h4>
                            <p>
                              Once similar spectra are identified, you can customize the following models:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Partial Least Squares (PLS)</li>
                              <li>Random Forest (RF)</li>
                              <li>Cubist</li>
                              <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</li>
                              <li>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h4>Customization Options</h4>
                            <p>
                              You can choose how to select similar spectra based on the following parameters:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li><strong>Distance-based Selection:</strong> Neighbors are selected based on their proximity to your data in the PCA space.</li>
                              <li><strong>Number of Neighbors:</strong> You can specify the exact number of similar spectra (neighbors) to use in the customization process.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                              By adjusting these settings, you can fine-tune the model to better suit your local data, enhancing prediction accuracy. For datasets with few samples, we recommend using the Distance-based Selection. Due to the nature of the data, we are unable to provide validation metrics for this feature.

                              In the card on the top right, select your soil property from the “Select Soil Property …” dropdown. Choose a Model Type – use the dropdown to select which machine learning model you would like to train for your data. Then, choose how to select your Neighbors – use the radio buttons and the slider input to select by distance or by number of neighbors per PCA point. The more neighbors you select, the longer the model will take to train and predict.

                              You can upload your own spectral data, define the response variable (measured soil property values), and build a machine-learning model that suits your needs. The preprocessing steps—including resampling—can be customized to your preference. You can perform resampling of your spectral data at every 10 cm<sup>-1</sup> or choose another interval that fits your needs. We recommend following all the spectral preprocessing steps for best results.

                            <p>
                              To build a machine learning model, your input data should include the following:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                              <li><strong>Measured Soil Property Value (Response Variable):</strong> This is the target variable you want to predict and must be included in your dataset.</li>
                              <li><strong>Preprocessed Spectral Data:</strong> Ensure that your spectral data has been preprocessed.</li>
                            </ul>

                              We expect to implement functionality to combine preprocessed data from the data aggregation page with a separate calc_value file soon, but for now this process must be done manually (see flow chart in “Which Tool is Right for Me?”).

                              Below the model training section, there is a box that allows you to upload a .rds, or .keras/.h5 model (for CNN). If PCA was used during training, click the <em>Use PCA</em> box and upload the .rds PCA model as well. Finally, upload your data file. This should be in a similar format to the files uploaded in the static models—ensure your data file matches the expected format of your model (for example, if your model was trained using data resampled at 50 cm<sup>-1</sup>, ensure your spectral data matches that). Also, ensure you have a Sample ID column at the beginning.
